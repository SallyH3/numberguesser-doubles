## Project Title
---
# NumberGuesser Doubles
---
As a partner project, we had to build a game where two users can guess a number between 1 and 100, with the ability for the user to add custom ranges for increased difficulty of play.
The game needed to provide the following:
1. display the current guess of both players
2. display the final results of each match in card UI
3. each card should display the name of the winner
4. each card should display both playerâ€™s names
5. each card should show how many guesses it took to guess the correct number
6. each card should have a delete button that removes the card from the page
7. game should be fully responsive and usable down to screens/viewport width of 320px

## Built With
---
* HTML
* CSS (FlexBox utilized)
* Vanilla JavaScript


## Motivation
---
We were motivated to learn JavaScript while simultaneously learning CSS. It was helpful to work side by side with 
someone and pair with others within the Turing program. This collaboration style helped us grow as developers and notice each other's strengths and challenges 
throughout the process.
